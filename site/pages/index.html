    title: Why choose Expert Writer?
    description: We have all heard the saying “publish or perish” and it has never been more true than today when the very survival in academia depends on the number of publications, H-index and other increasingly stringent requirements. To succeed in this highly competitive world, even those with flawless English can benefit from some professional support, as being highly knowledgeable on a particular subject may make it difficult to see the reader’s perspective or spot gaps in logic and flow in their manuscript. 
                   <br> <br>Yet, with the proliferation of editing companies, freelance platforms and AI-driven tools, it is virtually impossible to decide to whom to entrust your work, as the service needs to be reliable, competent, and expedient yet meet your budget.  
                   <br> <br>You may be tempted by the promise of endless rounds of free revisions, 3-tier editor systems, 24/7 availability of subject matter experts (SMEs) in every conceivable scientific field or other enticing perks on offer, but at the end of the day, all you want is to have your research presented in a way that is fit for publication or obtain a research grant.
