    description: With a PhD in Nuclear Biophysics and MSc in Computing from University of London, as well as proven track-record in investment banking as a software developer and quantitative analyst in City of London, in 2010 I embarked on a new career as a writer and editor at a time when WFH (working from home) was not even a possibility, let alone a well-known acronym.
                   <br> <br>Since then, I have edited countless documents as a British citizen working for an American company resulting in a long-list of satisfied clients that have subsequently recommended me to others.
                   <br> <br>This prompted me to form my own company and continue to serve international clients, but also opened up the opportunity to expand my reach within Serbia, where prices charged by large corporates are typically unaffordable, while the need for high-level academic English demanded by international peer-reviewed journals cannot be typically met by relying on local translators.

    description: As anyone that has published their research knows, academic writing is not just about correct grammar, verb-tense agreement, and correct choice of pronouns. It requires nuance that only those knowledgeable in that writing style who are familiar with the correct terminology in a particular field can provide.
                 <br> <br>This necessitates extensive editing experience in a variety of scientific and technical fields and ability to discern the meaning behind incorrectly worded statements, which is often the case for those for whom English is not the first (or even the second) language who may translate their original article literally or adopt sentence structures that are not appropriate in academic English.
                 <br> <br>As a dual national with the right international credentials and references from clients working in renowned universities and eminent institutions across the globe, I meet these requirements.

    description: As a sole company owner, I conduct all work personally and do not intend to employ any staff or entrust any of the work assigned to me to others. Thus, I can charge competitive prices while allowing all authors that need their work to be edited by a native English speaker to receive that service.
                 <br> <br>All communication is conducted via email directly with me, before, during and after the edit, and the price is based on the editing level, document length, and delivery deadline.
                 <br> <br>The high work quality and deadline is guaranteed and those that are new to the service can request a short editing sample to see the outcome of our potential collaboration.
                 <br> <br>If you are convinced that this is the service for you, peruse other website content to learn more about the editing levels and pricing.
                
                <br> <br>Your trusted editor,
